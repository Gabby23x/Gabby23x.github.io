            <figcaption> Gone Astray is a strategy platformer with unique 360-degree gravity manipulation. Players will
                guide Laika through a series of obstacles by harnessing the force of gravity. It is a single-player
                gameintended for audiences ages 13 and up. The setting and narration of the game draw from the story of
                the dog Laika, who was the first dog to orbit Earth. </figcaption>

            <h2 id="abstract">Brief Overview</h2>
            <p>In Gone Astray, players' screens remain fixed to the orientation of the ship rather than the direction of
                gravity, creating a more immersive experience with the game’s core movement mechanic. Gravity itself
                rotates, affecting certain obstacles in the environment and enabling unique interactions with minimal
                complexity. Characters can jump perpendicular to the platform they're on and stick to it regardless of
                gravity, allowing for fluid, flexible movement and distinctive level design that’s both simple to build
                and engaging to play.</p>

            <h2 id="citation">My Contributions</h2>
            <p>In the development of Gone Astray, I played multiple roles within our team. My primary role was as
                Project Lead, where I was in charge of keeping track of and clearly communicating tasks to team members,
                assigning tasks as necessary, facilitating communication between team members, handling team conflicts,
                and
                keeping the team on schedule. I also was a programmer and focused on implementing the core visual
                aspects of
                the game, which included the 360 degree earth gravity manipulator mechanic, the visual window setup
                and the interactive background, and the dynamic minimap. Additionally, I also contributed to the music
                composition of the game and worked on all of the sound tracks and integrated sound effects that
                enhanced the player's experience and complemented the game's
                atmosphere. My involvement in these areas was crucial to shaping the overall feel and functionality of
                Gone Astray.</p>

            <p> I learned a lot by working on Gone Astray. This project taught me valuable skills in teamwork, project
                management, and game design. Such as learning how to manage a project from beginning to end, creating
                and executing architecture for a game, effectively communicating with team members and learning how to
                incorporate feedback into the development process. Especially also learning how to prioritize tasks
                effectively. I also gained important programming skills, and learned how to create engaging gameplay
                mechanics that enhance the player's experience. I look forward to applying these skills in future
                projects.</strong> </p>

            <p>In the future, I plan to further work with my team Skye Studios to ship additional content updates for
                Gone Astray and launch on Steam by Fall 2025!!</p>
